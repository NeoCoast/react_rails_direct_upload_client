## Getting Started

- Clone this repo
- Install Node if you don't have it, expected version `18.0.0`
- Install Yarn if you don't have it (`npm install yarn`)
- Run `yarn install` to install all dependecies required by the project
- Create your .env file. Copy the contents of .env.example into this new .env file and set up your values. It's a good practice to keep the .env.example updated every time you need a new environment variable.
